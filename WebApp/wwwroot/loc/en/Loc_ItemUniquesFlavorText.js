Sadly, research and development is always shelved for the mundane task of skeleton assembly... \r\n\r\nP.S. I got it! I will build a construct that can summon skeletons autonomously!

It still needs a skeleton underneath, as bones are the scaffolding for my spells. And herein lies the problem - the enchantments are simply not powerful enough to move that massive armor\u2026 \r\n\r\nOne does not simply put a ton of metal on an undead skeleton, it seems.",
  "108": "My black knights are now complete, thanks to two breakthroughs!\n\n\nFirstly, I struck gold with a dusty alchemy book. It described an ancient cohesion elixir that I used to fill the space between bone and metal, greatly magnifying my enchantments!\n\n\nThe second breakthrough is entirely of my own. Bubbles! I am still not sure why exactly, but carbonating the formula has almost doubled its effectiveness! A big POP in the joint field of Necromancy and Alchemy!",
  "109": "Necromancy is dead, pun intended. I\u0027m writing a new chapter here. Sure, creating bone puppets is great and all, but I just changed the whole game.\r\n\r\nI managed to infuse an actual soul back into the bones! These guys aren\u0027t just stronger \u2013 they\u0027ve got the smarts!\r\n\r\nThough, on second thought, giving bones a brain might just backfire\u2026",

Thou didst pluck a lily, half-wilted, and set it upon my chest. I asked if \u0027twas a token, and thou said simply:\u00A0\u0027All things bloom again.\u0027\u00A0I heard thy meaning then - but I feel it more now.\r\n\r\nWith thee, I find myself not Count, nor Baron - only thine.\r\n~ Vlad",

Only closeness. Only us. \r\n\r\nThou didst not cast it away, yet neither didst thou wear it. Thy fingers closed soft upon it, as if it were a bird one dare not wake. Then turned thy gaze to the water, and said nothing more. I do not know what that silence meant.\r\n\r\nIt is thy nature, I know, to drift. To bloom, but not bind. I have loved that in thee. I still do. Yet now I wonder - am I to be part of thy stillness, or merely one who watches from the shore?\r\n\r\nI speak not in anger. Only in ache.\r\nIf I have erred, forgive me.
